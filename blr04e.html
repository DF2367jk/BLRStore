    <h1>No Long Term Care Insurance Horror Story !</h1>
    <h2 class="H2style">
      Your personal health insurance is not designed to cover your extended
      expenses for living in a nursing home.
    </h2>
    <p class="Para1">
      A friend of mine was very successful in sales. At around fifty years old,
      when she was planning for retirement, her husband became ill. It was
      apparent that he would decline, need nursing home care, and eventually
      pass early.
    </p>
    <p class="Para1">
      She did not have Long Term Care insurance. She had significant net worth
      both in real estate and investments. She had great health insurance.
    </p>
    <p class="Para1">
      After losing her husband’s income as he could no longer work. She was told
      that it was too late to move money into protected accounts, trusts, etc.
      as her husband’s condition was already established. She would have to pay
      $6,000 per month out of pocket for a nursing home. Once the family’s net
      worth was depleted the state would pick up the cost of the nursing home.
      She was unable to work the number of hours she was working in the past. If
      he made it another 10 years, should would have to start over at 60 years
      old.
    </p>
    <p class="Para1">
      To keep from touching her principal, she would need to draw 4% interest
      from her net worth to cover the nursing home expense. She would need to
      set aside $1,800,000 to fund the nursing home.
    </p>
    <p class="Para1">
      Had she purchased a $2,400,000 term policy with living benefits on her
      husband while he was healthy, she could have received $1,800,000 from the
      death benefit, while he was alive. The principal would have funded the
      nursing home for 20 years or 4% interest would have funded the expense
      indefinitely. She would have also been left with $500,000 of life
      insurance plus $1,800,000 of principal when he passed./p>
