      Do you know someone whose children are having trouble getting their first
      home?
    </h1>
    <h2 class="H2style">You can prevent this from happening to your child.</h2>
    <p class="Para1">Let us help your children avoid such a situation.</p>
    <p class="Para1">
      If you were planning to save $50.00/week for them for 10 years…. There may
      be a way to augment their retirement years with an additional $150,000 of
      income per year.
    </p>
    <p class="Para1">
      The same plan may be able to fund the down payment on their home!
    </p>
    <p class="Para1">
      Imagine you are retired and drawing 4% interest per year off your
      portfolio. The market has a couple negative years and you need to draw
      down your principal. This is how people outlive their money!
    </p>
    <p class="Para1">
      Wouldn’t it make sense to have an alternative source to draw from on down
      years so they do not have to touch their principal? You are saving for
      them anyway. Let’s see if there is a more effective way to prolong their
      quality of life.
