    <h1>You Have Choices</h1>
    <h2 class="H2style">
      You are young. You have choices. Since you are young the choices are more
      affordable.
    </h2>
    <h2 class="H2style">
      Look at the periods of your life and imagine what your family will need at
      each step (a little or a lot)
    </h2>
    <p class="Para1">
      Single (need to protect your income and have access to money in case you
      get hurt)
    </p>
    <p class="Para1">
      Married (number 1 plus protecting your income for at least 10 years)
    </p>
    <p class="Para1">Homeowner (protect the mortgage also)</p>
    <p class="Para1">
      Children (now it is time to speak with your spouse re feelings related to
      education)
    </p>
    <p class="Para1">
      Children (saving a little each week from day one can have a more profound
      effect than education)
    </p>
    <p class="Para1">
      Children have completed their education and are on their own (do you need
      as much)
    </p>
    <p class="Para1">Mortgage paid for (do you need as much)</p>
    <p class="Para1">
      Retired (life insurance may provide you with monthly checks)
    </p>
    <p class="Para1">
      Health issues but going to survive (life may provide you with a very large
      check)
    </p>
    <p class="Para1">
      You pass, did you choose to provide a lump sum or a fixed monthly amount
      for a number of years?
    </p>
    <h2 class="H2style">
      Ask me for an easy exercise to determine how much you need and when.
