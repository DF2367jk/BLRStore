    <h1>Know someone who became disabled full or partial after an accident?</h1>
    <p class="Para1">
      The brother of one of my friends was in a terrible car accident. He never
      walked again. However, he was able to return to work in a powerchair after
      a great deal of therapy.
    </p>
    <p class="Para1">
      His home had to be modified. He needed to purchase a modified van that was
      accessible. He could not drive. He needed a live-in care giver. His life
      expectancy was greatly affected and he eventually passed.
    </p>
    <p class="Para1">
      In addition to the auto insurance settlement from the accident, the
      disability insurance from his employer, he needed every penny he could
      find. His ability to earn was reduced and his expenses increased.
    </p>
    <p class="Para1">
      His requirement for assistance would have allowed him to use part of the
      death benefit from his life insurance if it was set up to allow this
      option.
