    <h1>Temporary or Permanent Life Insurance?</h1>
    <h2 class="H2style">Term Insurance</h2>

    <p class="Para1">
      This is temporary life insurance to cover a specific number of years. If
      unsure, get a policy that locks the rate in for a longer period of time.
      The policy ends at the end of the Term (20 years for example) or when you
      stop paying.
    </p>
    <h2 class="H2style">Permanent Life Insurance</h2>
    <p class="Para1">
      You will hear terms like Whole Life, Universal Life, etc. The insurance
      does not end until you pass. There are options regarding how you pay for
      the insurance. You can pay all at once, Annual, Monthly. You can also
      decide how many years you will contribute for 10 Years, 15 Years, 20
      Years, until you turn 65?
    </p>
    <h2 class="H2style">Riders</h2>
    <p class="Para1">
      You can cover all of your children under age 25 with a rider on your life
      insurance policy. Maybe it is an additional $10/month and your seven
      children have coverage. This is important as we do not buy life insurance,
      we apply for it. The life insurance company wants to make sure we are
      heathy enough to qualify.
    </p>
    <h2 class="H2style">Guaranteed Issue Final Expense</h2>
    <p class="Para1">
      This is a smaller policy with very few health questions to qualify. Most
      of the time you need to live for more than 24 months after it issues or
      they give you your money back instead of paying the life insurance amount.
