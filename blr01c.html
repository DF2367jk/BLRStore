        How come there is so much money available to help with retirement?
    </h1>
    <h2 class="H2style">Depending on what you studied in school they may or may not have explained the rule of 72 !</h2>
    <p class="Para1">At 7.2% interest, your money will double every 10 years.  The index we used for your illustration does not allow you to participate in negative years. At 10% interest, your money will double every 7.2 years.</p>
    <p class="Para1">Apply this to a newborn.  If they retire at 72, you did not have to fund them with a great deal of money as it will double many times.</p>
    <p class="Para1">Apply this to a 10-year-old.  You fund it with the same amount over the same number of years and they receive half a much.  The younger they are when they start makes a big difference.</h2>
    <p class="Para1">This is why we receive much less or need to fund with much more when we wait until we are 40 to start a plan like this.  Also, when you are older the amount of money needed to fund the life insurance portion is much more expensive.</p>
    <p class="Para1">The index we used for your illustration has averaged 7.5% over the past 25 years.</p>
    <p class="Para1">The index we used for your illustration does not allow you to participate in negative years.</p>
