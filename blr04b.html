    <h1>The coworker with much nicer home and autos and no stress?</h1>
    <h2 class="H2style">I asked my coworker to share his story:</h2>
    <p class="Para1">
      When he was a child, the car he was riding in was hit by a commercial
      vehicle. Both he and his mother were injured and received a settlement
      after treatment. His father used the money to purchase a home for him
      which was rented until he was old enough to take possession. He was able
      to sell the rental home and use the money as a large down payment on his
      current home. The full cost of housing had never affected his budget.
    </p>
    <p class="Para1">
      Let us protect you and your children from unexpected events that keep you
      from earning for an extended period of time while we put money away to
      help during your retirement years.
    </p>
    <p class="Para1">
      Many people are setting aside $50.00 per week per child to make sure their
      children are taken care of if an accident or if a serious illness like
      cancer keeps them from working for a period of time or need help with an
      down payment. Almost half of Americans will be financially impacted by the
      temporary inability to work prior to age 65. The same $50.00 per week can
      set the child up for a very comfortable retirement. We are doing this by
      contributing until they are 10 years old then letting the money grow.
    </p>
