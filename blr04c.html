    <h1>My Story</h1>
    <h2 class="H2style">
      Twice during my carrier, I was forced to go without income for an extended
      period through no fault of my own.
    </h2>
    <p class="Para1">
      Six weeks after major knee surgery I ask the surgeon how I can return to
      the office when I have not recovered well enough to use public facilities.
      He informs me the surgery did not go as planned and I would need to remain
      sedentary for at least another 6 months. This was just after an economic
      bubble had burst. My employer was downsizing and included me in an
      involuntary reduction of force. Many of my friends did their graduate work
      at one of the nation’s top law schools. One friend specialized in
      employment law at the time and verified that the company legally managed
      to lay me off when I was injured!
    </p>
    <h2 class="H2style">
      Many years later, as a small business owner, I am T-Boned in a traffic
      accident.
    </h2>
    <p class="Para1">
      Six months after the accident, the doctor pulls me aside. He asks what I
      am doing for a living, as I was seriously injured? I tell him I own a
      small insurance agency and own a couple automotive repair garages. He
      looks me in the eye, informs me he cannot tell me what to do, but… It is
      his professional experience that if I do not scuttle the businesses and
      move to a state where I have family for 2 years. Do nothing for 2
      additional years! He would expect to attend my funeral in the near future.
      Without prompting, a second doctor in the state which I had family,
      informed me “people in your condition” can simply die. Spoiler alert, I
      pulled through and now drive oversized vehicles.
    </p>
    <p class="Para1">
      These things happen! There is no need for them to financially affect your
      quality of life now or in the future.
