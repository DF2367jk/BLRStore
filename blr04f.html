    <h1>How can you pass suddenly and still be a hero?</h1>
    <h2 class="H2style">
      This is my little brother's story. The three little girls !
    </h2>
    <p class="Para1">
      One evening my sister-in-law was startled by a loud thump upstairs. She
      investigated and found my little brother on the floor in pain just before
      he lost consciousness. . Although he was my little brother by age, he was
      a very strong, tough, weightlifter who was indestructible.
    </p>
    <p class="Para1">
      He had tripped over one of the dogs, his own feet, something... He caught
      a corner of a piece of furniture under his ribs. His wife was a nurse and
      started CPR while requesting an ambulance on speaker phone. It took the
      ambulance 6 minutes to arrive. He had damaged an organ that started to
      bleed internally. He passed before the paramedics could take over the CPR.
    </p>
    <h2 class="H2style">The hero and the three little girls</h2>
    <p class="Para1">
      That is correct, young family, mortgage, two car loans, payments on one of
      the dog's recent surgeries! AND... three little girls. The youngest just
      started school!
    </p>
    <p class="Para1">
      He had a $500,000 term life insurance policy which was in effect. It took
      a little paperwork and 30 days for the insurance company to write a large
      check. They did send a smaller amount upon notice he had passed.
    </p>
    <p class="Para1">
      They were able to remain in their home, finish school with their friends,
      some are married, one made me a grand uncle, one is still in school.
    </p>
    <p class="Para1">
      This story would have ended much differently if he had not maintained his
      term life policy. I know he had it for a while as he was diagnosed with
      cancer 5 years earlier and became ineligible for more life insurance at
      that point. The cancer was in remission when he passed.
