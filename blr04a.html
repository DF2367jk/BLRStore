    <h1>Know someone who outlived their money?</h1>
    <h2 class="H2style">Retirement planning</h2>
    <p class="Para1">
      Regardless of if you have a traditional defined contribution or defined
      distribution retirement plan. You may have a 401k, IRA, 529, etc. You need
      other options. Start early to take advantage of compounding interest.
    </p>
    <h2 class="H2style">IUL or VUL</h2>
    <p class="Para1">
      One option is an indexed or variable life insurance policy. We can set up
      a life policy that purchases a minimal amount of insurance then saves
      money using the insurance companies’ ability to grow money on a pretax or
      qualified account. This is the only way to grow your money tax free and to
      have access to your money without fees and penalties if you need it. You
      have life insurance until you pass. You pay or save over a fixed number of
      years. The Cash Value protects you prior to retirement then can pay you
      during your retirement while maintaining life insurance.
    </p>
    <h2 class="H2style">Non correlated funds during market downturns</h2>
    <p class="Para1">
      This is even more important when you look at a chart of how the US stock
      market performs. We should be negative every 7 years. If you are living
      off your retirement plan, your portfolio, and other savings, the last
      thing you want to do is spend your principal! When we are in a down stock
      market year, replace the interest you would have taken from your portfolio
      with money from your life insurance and preserve your principal!
